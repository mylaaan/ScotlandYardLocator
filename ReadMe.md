<h1>Scotland Yard Locator</h1>
This is a little program to keep track of the possible locations of Mr./Ms. X.
<br>
All it does look up in a graph what the locations could be depending on what kind of transportation mode has been used. Including the black travel ticket.
<br>
This is mostly meant for situations where Mr. X has it a little to easy (by your own judgement) and the detectives could use an "IT upgrade". It does not help you actually locate Mr./Ms. X. It just provides you with a nice overview of possible locations.

This locator was based on de 2000 edition from Ravensburger. There is no certainty that other editions apart from the art are fully the same. Keep this in mind.
